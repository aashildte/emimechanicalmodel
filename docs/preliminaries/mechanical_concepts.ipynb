    "In continuum mechanics, stress extends the concept of force. It expresses the internal resistive force per unit area, at any given point, from all directions. For example, if one deforms a material by stretching it, internal forces work in the opposite direction.\n",

    "The relationship between stress and strain in a hyperelastic material is, per definition, given by a \\emph{strain energy function} $\\psi$ \\cite{Holzapfel2000}. More specifically, it is a Helmholtz free-energy function that can be expressed only dependent on factors of $\\mathbf{F}$. Often this is via components of $\\mathbf{E}$; of different invariants dependent on $\\mathbf{C}$; however, if written out explicitly, we can always get back to the deformation tensor $\\mathbf{F}$ itself. For ideal elastic solids, the strain energy is the potential energy converted from the work performed on the solid, which is a completely reversible process \\cite{Taber2020}.\n",

Mathematically, this implies that $\\psi (\\mathbf{F}) \\geq 0$ for all possible $\\mathbf{F}$ and $\\psi(\\mathbf{I}) = 0$. They are also usually monotonously increasing, although they might also capture a decreasing fracture region. If $\\psi$ is non-linear, we have a non-linear material, which is indeed the case for cardiac tissue – actually, most biological tissues can be modeled as such \\cite{Chagnon2015}. If it also is defined by a time-dependent component, also common for biological tissues \\cite{Taber2020}, we have a viscoelastic material - also a much-used approach in the cardiac mechanics' society.\n",
